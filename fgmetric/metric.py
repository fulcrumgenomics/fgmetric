    """
    Abstract base class for defining structured "metric" data models.

    This class combines Pydantic's `BaseModel` with `ABC` to provide a foundation for creating
    type-safe metric classes that can be easily read from and written to delimited text files (e.g.,
    TSV, CSV). It leverages Pydantic's automatic validation and type conversion while providing
    convenient class methods for parsing metrics from files.

    Metrics are delimited files containing a header and zero or more rows for metric values. When
    using a `Metric` to read a delimited file, the `Metric`'s fields correspond to the columns and
    header of the file. Subclasses should define their fields using Pydantic field annotations.

    `Metric` includes the following custom serialization/deserialization behaviors:
    1. **Empty fields as None.** Any empty field in a file will be represented as `None` on the
       deserialized model.
    2. **Delimited lists.** Any field typed as `list[T]` will be parsed from and serialized to a
       delimited string. The list delimiter may be controlled by the `collection_delimiter` class
       variable.

    Class Variables:
        list_delimiter: A single-character delimiter used to split and join `list` fields during
            serialization/deserialization.

    Example:
        ```python
        class AlignmentMetric(Metric):
            read_name: str
            mapping_quality: int
            is_duplicate: bool = False

        # Read metrics from a TSV file
        for metric in AlignmentMetric.read(Path("metrics.txt")):
            print(metric.read_name, metric.mapping_quality)
        ```

    # `None` before any field validators. 
    # For example, for delimited list parsing:
    #   - When a field is defined as `list[T] | None`, this converts "" → None before _split_lists
    #     sees it.
    #   - When a field is defined as `list[T]`, "" passes through unchanged, then _split_lists
    #     converts "" → [].

        Return the fieldnames to use as a header row when writing metrics to a file.

        This method is used by `MetricWriter` to construct the underlying `csv.DictWriter`.
        It returns the fieldnames that will appear in serialized output, which may differ from
        the model's field names when aliases are used.

        Note:
            This method is deliberately not used during reading/validation. Note that the `read()`
            method omits the `fieldnames` parameter from `csv.DictReader` so that any missing or
            misspecified fields are handled by pydantic's model validation.
