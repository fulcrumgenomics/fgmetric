    """
    A mixin to support pivot table representations of Counters.

    When this mixin is added to `Metric`, a field may be annotated as `Counter[T]`, and will be
    handled specially.

    This mixin permits only *one* field to be annotated as `Counter[T]`, and `T` must be a `StrEnum`
    type.

    During validation, fields in the input which match members of the enum type will be collected
    and included in a `Counter` on the validated model. If any members of the enum type are not
    found as fields in the input, they will be included with a count of 0 in the collected
    `Counter`.

    During serialization, the values of the associated `Counter` will be pivoted out, with one field
    in the output for each member of the enum type.

    **IMPORTANT:** As with all Python mixins, this class must precede `Metric` when declaring a
    *metric's parent classes, in order for its methods to take precedence over `Metric`'s defaults.
